# E-commerce-Back-End

For this project, I created a database using Node.js and sequelize to conenct all the different routes together to display different ecommerce databases. Within this, I can create, update, and delete different types of parts such as tags, products, and catergories. This is made possible by using Insomnia as my program to test out each GET, PULL, and DELETE request for each parts.
